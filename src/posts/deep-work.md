First of all, I recommend this book. It's pretty much common sense and it has
some flaws, but if you are at a point in your life where you feel overwhelmed
with the challenges that (work-) life throws at you and need to squeeze out just
an inch of extra energy and motivation to reach your goals, this is a viable
tool at best and a good little motivator at least.

This book has flaws, though. It is quite the irony, but given the title, this
book is the opposite of deep. It is shallow. Every single chapter follows the
same formula:

1. The author cherry-picks some person (usually from the distant past), event, 
   academic paper or study that makes an important point that fits the
   narrative.
1. The author then assumes that this one piece of evidence is authorative and
   conclusive and that it sufficiently proves his point.
1. Finally, now that we are convinced that the methods in this book are based on
   "scientific evidence", the author proposes a trick or tool or habit that
   would help to focus more on deep work.

All of the above is done in just a few sentences. This might be good, the book
will definitely not waste your time with endless blathering. It might also be
bad because if the examples don't exactly fit your current situation you might
be left with more questions than answers. You will have to think for yourself
on how to apply this to your life, but I personally think that is OK.

Like I said, I recommend this book. I have personally experienced everything
described in this book at some point in my life and so I certainly know that it
works. I don't need long pages of scientific evidence. Furthermore, I am fully
convinced that today's "normal" smartphone and social media usage is creating
immeasurable damage to our (and more importantly: our children's) brains.
Society desperately needs a wake-up call and if this flawed book is the best I
have in my library so far, then I will of course recommend it.

Who should read this book? I don't think that every job allows for deep work.
Especially as a CEO or politician, i.e. a person that heavily relies on
networking, being accessible, and being extremely well informed in order to see
the big picture, deep work seems to be hardly possible. However, if you are a
person that produces things and if craftmansship is required in your job in any
form, then this book is for you!

Here's another thing: I believe in the projections made in the book
"The Sovereign Individual". In the Information Age, very few will have great
amounts of power and wealth. Since we will live in an age where anyone will be
able to work from anywhere, you will have to compete with the entire global
work force. The only way to stick out is to be better than everyone else. To
make things worse, as we approach the Singularity, new crazy technology will
pop up in shorter and shorter cycles and you will need to master that technology
quickly if you want to stay relevant.

Being able to learn new and difficult things very quickly and being able to 
highly focus for hours and hours to solve difficult problems will be two
crucial skills that you will need to have. You might think that you already
have those skills, but deep down you know that you can always do just a little 
better. This book shows you various ways to do better.
