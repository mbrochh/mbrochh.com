If I remember correctly, I read this in 2011 for the first time and I have made it a habit to read it at the beginning of each year ever since.

It is a pretty quick read, written in exceptionally simple but precise language. If English is not your first language and you can't find a version in your language, I would still recommend to pick this up.

I truly believe that this book should be taught in school as early as possible. If every person on the planet practiced mindfulness meditation, the world would be a significantly better place. I now consider mindfulness meditation an essential life skill.

In case you are concerned: the book covers almost zero religious things, it does not try to convert you to Buddhism. It focuses simply on the raw, physical and mental skill of sitting down and just breath in order to meditate. You will learn how to sit, how to deal with pain and most importantly, how to deal with your racing "monkey mind".

In the many years since I discovered this book, I have often dropped the habit due to tight deadlines at work, stress, or simply other hobbies. Every year I eventually came back to this book and added meditation back into my daily routine. Every time when I did this, I could feel the positive effects of meditation after just three or four days.

You will not become an enlightened saint by reading this book. That would take decades of training and probably some guidance from actual meditation masters. But you will become a calmer and mentally more resillient person almost over night and you will learn a lot about yourself and the human condition.

Please give it a try!
