If you are anything like me, you have this huge amount of motivation at the end
of each year. You set yourself amazing goals for the new year. And it all works
in the first half of January... but come February, it is all forgotten and you
are back in your same old daily routine.

At the end of 2018, I was lucky to join <outbound-link href="https://thestartupbook.club/">The Startup Book Club</outbound-link> and
as part of that group I got to read Atomic Habits.

First of all, this book is really short. It took me three days or so to finish,
so even if you don't get any mind blowing insights out of it, it's not going to
waste a lot of your time. It's also written in super easy and accessible
language.

Secondly, it is very hands-on. Every chapter presents you with a nice little
anecdote, sometimes even about some scientific experiment and then has a call
to action. Each chapter builds on top of the previous ones, so at all times you
know what the author is trying to get at.

At the end of the book, you will have a little framework for how to get rid of
bad habits and how to get into good habits and all you need is a notebook and
a few hours of time to bend that framework to support your own life and your own
goals.

Everything is this book is incredibly simple and almost common sense and in the
end, this framework will not turn you into a superhuman - you still have to
exercise self-discipline yourself. For example, I have overloaded myself with
tons of new habits that I want to hammer into my life and now, one month later,
I can see how I am failing and some of them. Usually I would just give up and
tell myself that "I'm just not that kind of person" and go on with life.
Now I know that I have this book and this framework, so I can sit down, analyse
why some of my desired new habits are not working out and then take corrective
action.

I also found one trick in this book quite remarkable: It is not so much about
the goal that you set for yourself (i.e. manage to read 20 books per year). It
is also not about the systems that you set in place (i.e. buy a Kindle, place it
next to your bed, make sure you read every day). It is all about the identity
that you envision for yourself (i.e. "I am an avid reader"). If you manage to
make yourself believe that this is going to be your future identity and that
there will be some benefits waiting for you if you really become that identity,
then you will have a lot more intrinsic motivation to use your systems and meet
your goals. 

My whole life I always just set goals for myself, and then I made sure to meet
those goals. This was wrong. Now I need to create new identities for myself and
that forces me to think a lot harder about my future, my environment and myself.

I like that. This book really has potential to make a positive impact on
anyone's life with relatively little effort.

I would recommend this to anyone, especially while your New Year's Resolutions
are still fresh ;)
