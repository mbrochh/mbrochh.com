This book is seriously good and I consider it a must-read for anyone.

If you are working in marketing, sales or communications or any craft where you
need to use words to influence people, you have to read this. If you are working
in academics and you conduct studies and research, you have to read this. If you
are a project manager or a decision maker, you have to read this. If you are an
investor, definitely read this. If you are an every-day person just trying to
make the best out of your life: You too should read this.

Although the entire book is basically about statistics, the author expertly
kept the math at a minimum and managed to put everything into easy to
understand words, giving relateable real world examples or explaning exactly
how certain studies were carried out.

The first two chapters are really fun. The author keeps asking you to perform
certain thinking tasks and then goes on to describe EXACTLY what just went on
in your brain and in pretty much 100% of all examples my brain acted exactly
as predicted by the book. Amazing stuff.

Despite the accessible language, this book definitely is a bit dense. You will
not read this and then put it down and know exactly how to improve your life. I
think this is the kind of book that you will have in your personal collection
for a long time and every now and then you will remember that there was some
concept described that might now be relevant to your life and then you will
return to this book and re-read that chapter. That's why I highly recommend to
take notes and summarize each concept in this book. Then you can at least
re-read your summary regularly.

I personally got a lot out of this. I manage teams, I plan large scale projects,
I make investments, I try to establish good habits and maximise happiness in my
life. This book has provided me with super valuable insights that will improve
all these aspects of my life.

I can highly recommend this book. I read this as part of a book club and
