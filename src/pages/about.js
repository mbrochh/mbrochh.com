    <h1>Welcome to My Personal Blog</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Martin. I have been building web applications since 1998, but
      of course we didn't call it "web application" back then. I was born in
      Germany but I left the country in 2011 to marry my wife in Singapore.
    </p>
    <h2>Work</h2>
    <p>
      I'm the founder of{' '}
      <OutboundLink href="https://bitlabstudio.com">Bitlab Studio</OutboundLink>
      . We are a small but well established web agency based in Singapore (Pte
      Ltd) and Germany (GmbH). Our core competence is building web applications
      and mobile applications based on{' '}
      <OutboundLink href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</OutboundLink>,{' '}
      <OutboundLink href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</OutboundLink>,{' '}
      <OutboundLink href="https://reactjs.org/">React</OutboundLink> and{' '}
      <OutboundLink href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">
        ReactNative
      </OutboundLink>
      .

    <h2>The Artling & Publishizer</h2>
    <p>
      At Bitlab Studio, we love to work with young startups and so it happened
      that I am working as the CTO of{' '}
      <OutboundLink href="https://theartling.com">The Artling</OutboundLink>{' '}
      since 2015. During my time with The Artling, we also released{' '}
      <OutboundLink href="https://luxglove.com">Luxglove</OutboundLink> under
      the umbrella of The Artling and managed to raise{' '}
      <OutboundLink href="https://www.techinasia.com/the-artling-series-a-artshare-acquisition">
        $1.8m in series A funding
      </OutboundLink>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I joined The Artling, I wrote the first version of{' '}
      <OutboundLink href="https://publishizer.com">Publishizer</OutboundLink>.
      As of today, this is probably one of our longest running web applications.
    </p>
    <h2>PyCon Singapore & Python User Group Singapore</h2>
    <p>
      Since 2013 I have been heavily involved with organizing the{' '}
      <OutboundLink href="https://pycon.sg">
        annual Python conference in Singapore
      </OutboundLink>
      . I also organize the monthly{' '}
      <OutboundLink href="https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Python-User-Group/">
        Python User Group Singapore meetup
      </OutboundLink>
      .
    </p>
    <h2>Teaching</h2>
    <p>
      Since 2017 I have been giving introductory Python classes at{' '}
      <OutboundLink href="https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/martin-brochhaus/7500">
        General Assembly
      </OutboundLink>{' '}
      and through my engagement there I was invited to speak at various
      conferences and panel discussions in Singapore.
    </p>
    <h2>Bitcoin</h2>
    <p>
      We are currently witnessing the transformation of our society from the
      industrial age into the information age. Crypto currencies play a major
      role in this process and will change virtually every aspect of life within
      the next 20 years or so, just like the internet did in the past 20 years.
      I have spent thousands of hours reading everything about Bitcoin there is
      to read and if time allows, I will become a bit more active in the space
      in 2019.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you would like to send me a tip, here is my BTC address:
      3Q2WiXSnA8Ba36GbFJZp1YFY4xT7ex9x9K
    </p>
    <h2>Credits</h2>
    <p>
      My main inspiration to finally take some time and setup a new blog came
      from{' '}
      <OutboundLink href="https://overreacted.io/">
        Dan Abramov's new blog
      </OutboundLink>
      . I learned quite a bit from his repository, especially how to show code
      snippets in GatsbyJS.
    </p>
    <p>
      The design and structure of this blog is heavily influenced by{' '}
      <OutboundLink href="">Amjad Masad's blog</OutboundLink>. However, I built
      it all myself, never looked at his codebase ;)
    </p>
    <p>
      This blog is built with{' '}
      <OutboundLink href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">GatsbyJS</OutboundLink> and
      hosted on{' '}
      <OutboundLink href="https://www.netlify.com/">netlify</OutboundLink>,
      which are both pretty amazing tools.
